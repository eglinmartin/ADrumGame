# A Drum Game

Prototype PyGame dumming game. Cross between an educational tool on basic drum beats and a silly desktop toy.

## Gameplay
Can you play drums? You can? ...Can you play them jankily with a keyboard...?

A Drum Game forces you to ditch the drumsticks and play freestyle drums with your keyboard.

## To-do list of features

This game is currently pending a move to Lua (faster, more adaptable to new systems).

Features to add in the Lua version will include:
- A proper control menu
- Widescreen (16:9)
- Levels (easier -> harder drum beats)
- An angry bald man that throws chairs at you when you cock it up
- Story mode?
- Microtransactions (probably not)
